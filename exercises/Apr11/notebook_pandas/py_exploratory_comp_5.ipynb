    "### Sorting DataFrames\n",
    "DataFrames may be sorted with the `.sort` function. The keyword `inplace=True` replaces the values in the DataFrame with the new sorted values (when `inplace=False` a new DataFrame is returned, which you can store in a separate variable so that you have two datasets, one sorted and one unsorted). The `sort` funcion has several keyword arguments, including `columns` which is either the name of one column to sort by or a list of columns so that data is sorted by the first specified column and when values are equal they are sorted by the next column in the list. Another keyword is `ascending`, which you can use to specify whether to sort in ascending order (`ascending=True`, which is the default), or descending order (`ascending=False`)"

    "### Renaming columns\n",
    "Sometimes (quite often, really), the name of columns in a dataset are not very convenient (long, including spaces, etc.). For the example of the transportation data, the columns have convenient names, but let's change them for demonstration purposes. You can rename columns inplace, and you can change as many columns as you want. The old and new names are specified with a Python dictionary. A dictionary is a very useful data type. It is specified between braces `{}`, and links a word in the dictionary to a value. The value can be anything. You can then use the word in the dictionary as the index, just like you would look up a word in an paper dictionary."

At the top of the file, an explanation is given of the data in the file. Read this. Load the data file with the `read_csv` function of `pandas`. Use the keyword `skiprows` to skip all rows except for the row with the names of the columns. Use the keyword `parse_dates` to give either the name or number of the column that needs to be converted to a datetime. Don't forget the `skipinitialspace` keyword, else the names of the columns may start with a bunch of spaces. Perform the following tasks:\n",
    "* Some rainfall values in the dataset may be -1 (read the header of the file to learn why); set all rainfall values that are less than zero to zero. \n",
    "* Use the `plot` function of `pandas` to create a line plot of the daily rainfall with the number of the day (so not the date) along the horizontal axis. \n",

    "### Resampling\n",
    "DataFrames have a very powerful feature called resampling. Downsampling refers to going from high frequency to low frequency. For example, going from daily data to monthly data. Upsampling refers to going from low frequency to high frequency. For example going from monthly data to daily data. For both upsampling and downsampling, you need to tell `pandas` how to perform the resampling. Here we discuss downsampling, where we computed monthly totals from daily values. First we load the daily rainfall in Rotterdam in 2012 from the file `rotterdam_rainfall_2012.txt` and specify the dates as the index (this is the column labeled as `YYYYMMDD`). We resample the rain to monthly totals using the `resample` function. You have to tell the `resample` function to what frequency it needs to resample. Common ones are `'A'` for yearly, `'M'` for monthly, `'W'` for weekly, `'D'` for daily, and `'H'` for hourly, but there are many other ones (see  [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.12.0/timeseries.html).  The keyword argument `how` is used to tell `pandas` how to compute the resampled data. This can be many things, like `'mean'` for the mean (that is the default), `'sum'` for the total, `'min'`, `'max'`, etc. The keyword argument `kind` is used to tell `pandas` where to assign the computed value to. You can assign the computed value to the last day of the period, or the first day, or to the entire period (in this case the entire month). The latter is done by specifying `kind='period'`, which is what we will do here. Calculating the montly totals and making a bar graph can now be done with `pandas` as follows. "
